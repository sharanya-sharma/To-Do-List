# To-Do-List
# Overview
The To-Do List Application is a Python-based project designed to help users efficiently manage and organize their tasks. Users can create, update, and track their to-do lists using a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI). The application allows for task persistence through file storage, ensuring that users' tasks are saved and can be accessed during subsequent sessions.
